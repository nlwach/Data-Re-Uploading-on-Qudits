# Bachelor thesis "Data Re-Uploading on Qudits"
This repository includes all necessary jupyter notebooks to recreate the data presented in my bachelor thesis "Data Re-Uploading on Qudits". (https://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/Veroeffentlichungen/download.php/6701/temp/4216.pdf)

Each folder contains a specific QML model wich was trained under various different conditions on the same dataset.
I also provide one notebook which illustrates the analysis of the collected data and a python file to visualize quantum states on a qudit.
